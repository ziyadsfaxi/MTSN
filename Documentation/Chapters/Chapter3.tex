\section{Estimated Timeline}
Because MTS will be developed by using prototyping model, It is estimated that the thired prototype would be stable enough to be published in the Google Play - The market of android's applications -.\linebreak \\

The second and first prototype are to find bugs and security issues in earlier time which reduce the risk and minimize the cost of fixing.\linebreak \\

Each prototype needs at least twenty-one weeks to be fully deployed. Furthermore, the work of a following prototype would be established on the nineteenth week of previous prototype. \\
